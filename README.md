# Lesson_01 

 
 

Hello class for this lesson we are going to focus on setting up.  

Step 1: Create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> Account. This should already done because you're reading this.  


Step 2: Download and install <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Desktop</a>.<br /> 
-login to your newly created git account. 
 
Step 3: Download and install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Studio Code</a>.<br /> 
-Select a theme you like. (Negative points for not dark mode).<br /> 
-In VScode select File > Open, select your documents folder and create a new folder inside (I suggest you call it HTML Lesson 01), select the new folder and select open. 

Step 4: In your explorer tab in VS Code (Top Left), underneath explorer it should say the name of the folder you created. Rightclick on any space underneath that and create a new file. Name it index.html (if you have a bunch of html pages in a folder hosted online, your browser will always open index.html first).<br /> 

-Lets make your (likely) first website, Luckly VScode has an autofill feature that should make this easier.<br /> 
-open index.html in line 1 type ! and then press tab ( â†’| ).<br /> 
-notice how sections are wrapped with \<something>\</something>? This is how HTML works.<br /> 
-by default a website is divided into two sections head and body. head is for metadata and linking to stylesheets, libraries, external Javascript stuff... (I'll explain later). But for now just rename the title to whatever you want, and you can change lang to sv if you wish.<br /> 
-in the body Section type out \<h1>Hello World\</h1><br /> 
-Save your file(cmd + s).<br /> 


Step 5: In your finder go to documents and open your folder, and double click on index.html... BEHOLD! your first website. h1 is a html tag that makes the text large, there is also h2, h3, h4 etc. if you notice at the top of your tab, it takes on the title of your website. 


Step 6: Upload to git. this is an industry standard practice; you do not want your files to only exist on your computer. Especially if you are working on a big project. in Github desktop select Current Repository (top right) > Add > create new repository. Name it (Lesson 1) and select Create Repository.<br /> 
-Title your commit (Created index.html) and select commit to main<br /> 
-push origin.<br />
